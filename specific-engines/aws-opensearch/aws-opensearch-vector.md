    - I went through this workshop but ran into issues in Module 4. Even before this point the workshop instructions and the notebook were diverging in what they were saying. At this step I started getting errors. I think the fix for this particular issue is pretty straightforward but I'm not going to spend more time with this workshop, hopefully Amazon will fix at some point.
