Lucene is the best known open source search engine library. It forms the core of popular software like Elasticsearch, OpenSearch, Apache Solr, and Neo4j.

## Implementations
- [Lucene.NET](https://lucenenet.apache.org/index.html)
    - [Examine](https://github.com/Shazwazza/Examine)
        - A search engine implementation on top of Lucene.NET, e.g. somewhat similar to Solr.
- [PyLucene](https://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/)
    - A wrapper around the Java library, not an actual port.
    - [lupyne](https://github.com/coady/lupyne)
