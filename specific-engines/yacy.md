- LinuxReviews
    - LinuxReviews has a fairly negative opinion of YaCy overall but sees a glimmer of opportunity for the engine. Unfortunately, the articles have not been updated since 2019/2021 respectively leaving some gap between what is described and what may now be YaCy's status. That said there is a decent amount of helpful technical info. to be found in the articles.
