## Footnotes

[^yahoo]: Yahoo is quite high for web traffic but it has long outsourced its search results to Bing. We are not aware of any significant innovations Yahoo is making to the Bing results before displaying them and we are unaware of any such innovations on the horizon. However, the high traffic does mean that it could easily innovate on the search front and become a competitor.

[^ask]: Ask pulls from Google, similarly to how Yahoo pulls from Bing. Again, we don't see significant innovations layered on top of the Google results nor any such on the horizon. As with Yahoo, Ask could quickly become a competitor if it so chose.

[^ecosia]: Ecosia sources its results from Bing and is a similar situation to Yahoo/Ask. It has an emphasis on earth-friendly / social good.

[^startpage]: Startpage uses Google results, is similar DDG, but has enough traffic to make it a potentially serious competitor. Startpage is descended from Ixquick which was a meta search engine.

[^searchencrypt]: Search Encrypt is similar to Startpage and DDG. It uses Bing for results and again is listed because of its high traffic.

[^qwant]: Qwant uses Bing results to supplement its own index, offers a Boards application which allows for sharing and annotating web content.

[^dogpile]: Dogpile is a meta search engine \(owned by InfoSpace\), one of the older engines on the net. It doesn't seem to be particularly distinguished from others but could probably offer competition if it placed energies towards significant innovation.

[^gigablast]: Gigablast could easily have been excluded from this list. It appears to have stagnated to a large extent.

[^metager]: Metager is part of the non-profit organization SUMA-EV. It was started at the University of Hanover in 1996. While not the highest trafficked apparently pulls results from numerous search engines \(aka, it is meta\),and offers some helpful customization options for results. It has [released its source code as open source](https://gitlab.metager.de/open-source/MetaGer), and offers privacy. Impressive!

[^yippy]: Yippy is powered by IBM Watson, uses Bing for at least some of tis results, its most interesting feature is its ability to cluster results into topics - e.g., searching for "Civil War" one might be interested in the American Civil War, the comic book movie, a civil war in another country, etc. Yippy helps one quickly filter out irrelevant results.

[^whaleslide]: Whaleslide is lowly trafficked according to SimilarWeb but the site seems to offer some innovative features. In addition to donating to non-profits with revenue generated, its site design is slick and performant, one can "pin sites" and also add them to collections, and it is privacy focused.

[^infospace]: InfoSpace appears to pull results from Bing. It is also the owner of Dogpile and WebCrawler.

[^etools]: eTools is included not because of high traffic but due to the customizability of the engine. It is a metasearch engine that can query 16 different search engines and allows the user to determine the weight of each engine. It also shows in the results which search engines returned which results \(including when multiple returned the same result\).

[^alltheinternet]: Also owns [Searchalot](https://searchalot.com/). The owning company is Advanced Search Technologies which has been in operation since 1999. It appears they have their own search engine and the result quality is decent.

[^gibiru]: According to the site it has been operating since 2009 and provides "uncensored private search." At the footer of search results it states it is an "Anonymous Proxy Search Engine." This likely indicates that the results are pulled ffrom elsewhere but anonymized. The results also include a tab "Censored Content" though it is unclear what exactly makes the content censored.

[^swisscows]: A well-established, anonymous search engine.

[^oscobo]: Interestingly the search results are returned from [Becovi](https://becovi.com/) which (among other things) does SEM.

[^wiby]: "The Wiby search engine is building a web of pages as it was in the earlier days of the internet." It's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/wibyweb/wiby/) under a GPLv2 license.

[^marginalia]: With similar goals to Wiby, Marginalia surfaces the indie web. The [source code](https://git.marginalia.nu/marginalia/marginalia.nu) is available under the GNU Affero GPL v3 or later.

[^neeva]: An ad-free search engine. Offers a limited free account with subscription accounts less than $6/mo. Provides some customizability of search results by selecting preferred sources (e.g. The New York Times, Wikipedia).

[^kagi]: Ad-free search engine, offers limited personal accounts. Subscription account is $10/mo, similar model to Neeva. Allows one to raise/lower/pin/block specific sites.

[^hotbot]: Originally launched in 1996 by Wired Magazine using Inktomi technology and was acquired by Lycos. Unfortunately, it was allowed to stagnate. It has since been relaunched though using new technology but it is unclear what connection, if any, the search engine maintains with it's original founders.

[^alexandria]: This search engine uses Common Crawl data and the source code of the engine is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/alexandria-org).

[^andi]: Techcrunch has a [nice writeup on Andi](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/13/y-combinator-backed-andi-taps-ai-to-built-a-better-search-engine/).

[^phind]: Formerly sayhello.

[^mwmbl]: Open source, free, non-profit.
