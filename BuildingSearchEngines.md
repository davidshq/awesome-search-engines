## Footnotes
[^controversy]: The fork was started following controversial licensing changes by Elasticsearch. For more on the history of this controversy see Graham Gillen's [Elasticsearch vs OpenSearch series](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2021/elasticsearch-vs-opensearch-user-point-of-view-part-1-of-3/). For a brief evaluation of OpenSearch's progress see Matt Asay's [One year of OpenSearch: Grading AWS‚Äô open source effort](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/opensearch-grading-aws-open-source/).
[^typesense]: Some interesting functionality includes tunable ranking, sorting, faceting & filtering, grouping & distinct, federated search, and curation. It doesn't appear to be in web scale usage but they've expressed interest in benchmarking larger datasets so I submmited an [issue requesting CommonCrawl be benchmarked](https://github.com/typesense/typesense/issues/933).
[^opensemanticsearch]: It isn't meant for web search particularly but it offers a number of features which could be useful in a search engine - e.g. exploratory search as well as collaborative annotation and tagging.
[^mwmbl]: The project has some similarities with what I'm looking to do with [Phoebe](https://github.com/davidshq/next-search/). It is open source, a non-profit, and the code is written in Python.
