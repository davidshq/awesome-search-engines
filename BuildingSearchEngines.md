    - [Common Crawl WARC Examples](https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-warc-examples) - "This repository contains both wrappers for processing WARC files in Hadoop MapReduce jobs and also Hadoop examples to get you started."
    - [Jupyter Notebooks to Analyze Common Crawl Data](https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-notebooks) - This includes several different notebooks, some may be especially interested in [running a notebook on AWS EMR](https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-notebooks/blob/main/cc-emr-notebook/cluster_setup.md).
    - [Common Crawl PySpark Examples](https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-pyspark) - "This project provides examples [of] how to process the Common Crawl dataset with Apache Spark and Python".
    - [Common Crawl Index Server](https://github.com/commoncrawl/cc-index-server) - "This project is a deployment of the pywb web archive replay and index server to provide an index query mechanism for datasets provided by Common Crawl".

## Footnotes
[^controversy]: The fork was started following controversial licensing changes by Elasticsearch. For more on the history of this controversy see Graham Gillen's [Elasticsearch vs OpenSearch series](https://pureinsights.com/blog/2021/elasticsearch-vs-opensearch-user-point-of-view-part-1-of-3/). For a brief evaluation of OpenSearch's progress see Matt Asay's [One year of OpenSearch: Grading AWSâ€™ open source effort](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/opensearch-grading-aws-open-source/).
[^typesense]: Some interesting functionality includes tunable ranking, sorting, faceting & filtering, grouping & distinct, federated search, and curation. It doesn't appear to be in web scale usage but they've expressed interest in benchmarking larger datasets so I submmited an [issue requesting CommonCrawl be benchmarked](https://github.com/typesense/typesense/issues/933).
