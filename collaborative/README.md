# Collaborative Search Engines Till Now

## Introduction

I am particulary interested in human augmented search engines and am [working towards building one](https://github.com/davidshq/next-search). I've decided to collect information regarding collaborative search engines here.

## Engines
- [ApexKB / Jumper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ApexKB)
    - Last Release: 11/2010
- [Seeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeks)
    - Last Release: 4/2012
    - [Searx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searx) - While inspired by Seeks it does not provide the collaborative search aspect.

## Wikipedia Articles
- [Collaborative search engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_search_engine)
    - "let users combine their efforts in information retrieval (IR) activities, share information resources collaboratively using knowledge tags, and allow experts to guide less experienced people through their searches. Collaboration partners do so by providing query terms, collective tagging, adding comments or opinions, rating search results, and links clicked of former (successful) IR activities to users having the same or a related information need."
