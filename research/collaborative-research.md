    - "The ResultsSpace Collaborative Search Environment is a tool to support asynchronous collaborative information retrieval among a small group of collaborators. It is designed to promote awareness of collaborators' searches and the documents they have rated. Awareness is supported through several mechanisms: an area that shows a history of queries, a summary display of collaborators' ratings next to each search result, and changes in the visual salience of search results based on their aggregate rating from all collaborators. Faceted controls allow users to filter results based on specific ratings (relevant, not relevant, and maybe) and on specific collaborator(s) who have rated an item."

    - "We describe a social search technique that harnesses the search experiences of a community of searchers to generate result recommendations, in a collaborative fashion, to complement results returned from some underlying search engine. We describe a dynamic model of trust as a way to coordinate collaboration, and provide experimental results to show that search performance improves as the network evolves."

    - "ISKODOR integrates personal collections, peer search, and centralized search services. User modeling in ISKODOR fills three roles: discovery of sites with suitable information stores, context-based query interpretation, and automatic profile-based filtering of new information. Explanation and control are achieved through graphical depiction of sources, explicit feedback regard ingutility, and explicit control over peer association behavior and information sharing."
