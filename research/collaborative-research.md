## 2007
- Athanasios Papagelis, Christos Zaroliagis. [Searchius: A Collaborative Search Engine](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4282197_Searchius_A_Collaborative_Search_Engine). 10/2007.
    - "Searchius is a collaborative search engine that produces search results based solely on user provided web-related data. We discuss the architecture of the system and how it compares to current state-of-the-art search engines." - 1.
    - "URLs can be explicitly collected (e.g., bookmarks) or implicitly collected (e.g., web-browsing history). These collections of web-related data can be combined, without loosing [sp] their discrete nature, to produce a view of the web from the user perspective." - 1.
        - DM: It would be interesting to add to the ranking algorithm an analysis of sites visited versus sites bookmarked. e.g., it seems likely that sites visited once and never bookmarked across a large number of users are links of low quality.
    - "Our approach is based on the observation that the web users act as small crawlers seeking information on the web using various media, which they subsequently store and organize into tree-like structures inside their information spaces." - 1.
    - "...Searchius is not capital intensive, since it concentrateson a small portion of the data that typical search enginescollect and analyze." - 1.
    - "To order pages by importance,Searchius uses an aggregation function based on the preference to pages by different users, thus avoiding the expen-sive iterative procedure of PageRank." - 1.
    - "Finally, the way peo-ple organize their bookmarks can be used to segment theURL space to relative sub-spaces. This property can be ex-ploited to provide efficient solutions to other applications,including the construction of web catalogs and finding re-lated URLs." - 1.
    - "Under the above context, the ranking of pages inSearchius is based on how many *different* users have votedfor a specific page p. The total number of such votes is called the *UsersRank of page p*." - 2.
    - "The Noise Reducer uses heuristic filters to removefrom the database low quality URLs." - 3.
    - "Searchius uses a similar approach. The IR score of a pageis calculated based on the page title, URL and semantic tag-ging given by users. This semantic tagging is the exact ana-log to anchor links and can produce diverse descriptions ofpages." - 3.
        - DM: The use of aggregate user provided titles, descriptions, and semantic tags instead of actual page content is an interesting idea. I would see this as additive, e.g., one could perform ranking on page rank, user rank, IR score, and user IR score.
    - "To cope with such problems,we introduce an aging procedure for the collected pages. Atpredefined time intervals we reduce the value of each pagein the Searchius database. Since we use a simple value ag-gregation procedure to find the most important pages for asearch query, the effect of old URL collections to search-ing results diminishes through time allowing more room forfresh data." - 4.
        - DM: This is an interesting approach to ensuring that newer pages have a chance to surface in the results while also allowing older pages to retain their authority if they continue to be widely utilized.
    - "The quality of page ordering will be benefited by implicit collection of URLs for three reasons. First, the pages wevisit determine with high accuracy our current interests. Ifwe can monitor the users browsing history then we can al-ways produce a fresh view of how the web dynamics evolve.On the contrary, bookmark collections may be somewhatoutdated. Second, the frequency of visiting specific pagesgives a much better indication of our relative preference forspecific sites than the bookmark collections. Third, the order in which we visit sites can also be used and exploitedin many ways. For example, frequently subsequent sites ina browsing history can be linked as belonging to the same theme." - 4.
    - "When a user adds several pages under a folderhe actually groups them by some sort of similarity. Thisinfers that folders partition the URL-space to conceptuallyrelated sub-spaces." - 4.
